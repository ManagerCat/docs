:::important
This is applicable for supertokens core version >= 3.7.

This feature allows you delete a user from the SuperTokens based on their user ID.

}

async def do_delete():
    user_id = "..." # get the user ID somehow...
    await delete_user(user_id) # this will succeed even if the userId didn't exist.

:::caution
- Calling this function will permanently remove all information associated with this user, including their sessions.
- If this user has an active access token, and you have not enabled access token blacklisting, session verificaiton will still succeed until their access token expires. After that, they will be logged out since session refresh will fail.
