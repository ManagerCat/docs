# Access Session Info In GraphQL Operations

GraphQL passes the context object (refer to [backend setup](./backend-setup#d-add-a-graphql-endpoint-with-optional-session-verification)) to your resolvers, you can use this context to set and read session information.

```tsx
var resolvers = {
    foo: (_: any, context: any) => {
        if (context.session !== undefined) {
            // Use the session object, for example context.session.getUserId()
        } else {
            // Session does not exist
        }
    }
}
```
