# Getting the JWKS endpoint and issuer URLs

:::caution
Using JWTs is optional and is only required if you want to integrate with another service that relies on JWTs or if you want to integrate with a backend framework that we do not support yet
:::

## Issuer

By default SuperTokens uses <BackendSDKCasing>{apiDomain}/{apiBasePath}</BackendSDKCasing> as the issuer URL. The value of <BackendSDKCasing>{apiBasePath}</BackendSDKCasing> is `/auth` by default, so for example, if your <BackendSDKCasing>{apiDomain}</BackendSDKCasing> is `http://localhost:8000`, then the full issuer URL is `http://localhost:8000/auth`.

If you want to use a custom issuer URL refer to [this page](./enabling-jwts#using-a-custom-issuer)

## JWKS URL

SuperTokens exposes a Json Web Key Set on `{issuer}/jwt/jwks.json`
