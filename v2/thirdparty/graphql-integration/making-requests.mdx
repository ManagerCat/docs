# Making Requests

:::info
SuperTokens uses cookies for session verification. This means that no additional token required when making requests
:::

## Using fetch

SuperTokens adds request and response interceptors for fetch automatically, this is also applicable for any GraphQL clients that use fetch internally (for example Apollo). No additional steps are required.

## Using axios

:::important
You must call `addAxiosInterceptors` on all `axios` imports.
:::

```tsx
import axios from "axios";
// highlight-start
import Session from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session";
Session.addAxiosInterceptors(axios);
// highlight-end

async function callAPI() {
    // use axios as you normally do
    let response = await axios.get("https://yourapi.com");
}
```
