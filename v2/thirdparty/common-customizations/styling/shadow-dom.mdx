# Disable use of shadow DOM

We use [Shadow DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) to prevent CSS clashes between your CSS and the ones we provide. This guarantees that all our UI will render as expected.

However, this has a few problems:
- You cannot override our CSS using your CSS (though you can [use JS to do that](./changing-style)).
- Password managers may not work for your end user.

If you want to disable use of shadow dom, you can do so like:

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";
import ThirdParty from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/thirdparty";
import Session from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/session";

SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "..."
    },
    recipeList: [
        ThirdParty.init({
            // highlight-next-line
            useShadowDom: false
        }),
        Session.init()
    ]
});
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

:::caution
If disabled, please be sure to check that our components render correctly - because your CSS might affect our components' UI (the other way around won't happen).
