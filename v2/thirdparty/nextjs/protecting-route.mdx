# 4. Protecting a website route

Protecting a website route means that it cannot be accessed unless a user is signed in. If a non signed in user tries to access it, they will be redirected to the login page.

Let's say we want to protect the home page of your website (`/` route). In this case, we can edit the `/pages/index.js` file to add an auth wrapper around your `Home` component like so:

```tsx title="pages/index.ts"
import React from 'react'
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'
import ^{recipeNameCapitalLetters} from 'supertokens-auth-react/recipe/^{codeImportRecipeName}'
// @ts-ignore
import ProtectedPage from "./protectedPage";

const ^{recipeNameCapitalLetters}AuthNoSSR = dynamic(
  new Promise((res) =>
    res(^{recipeNameCapitalLetters}.^{recipeNameCapitalLetters}Auth)
  ) as any,
  { ssr: false }
)

export default function Home() {
  return (
    // we protect ProtectedPage by wrapping it
    // with ThirdPartyEmailPasswordAuthNoSSR

    <^{recipeNameCapitalLetters}AuthNoSSR>
      <ProtectedPage />
    </^{recipeNameCapitalLetters}AuthNoSSR>
  )
}
```

:::important
An example of this can be seen [here](https://github.com/supertokens/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-supertokens/pages/index.js#L36).

:::tip Test by navigating to `/`
You should be redirected to the login page. After that, sign in, and then visit `/` again. This time, there should be no redirection.
