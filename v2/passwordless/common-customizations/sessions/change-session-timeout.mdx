# Change session timeout

:::important
By default, the session timeout is for 100 days.

This means that a user will get logged out only after 100 days of inactivity. To put this another way, if a user is active even once in a 100 days (after the access token expires), their session's lifetime is extended by another 100 days.
:::

This value can be changed by:
- Changing the `refresh_token_validity` value (time in mins): Determines the overall session timeout.
   - The default is 100 days.
- Changing the `access_token_validity` value (time in seconds): Does not affect the overall session timeout, but affects how often session refreshing occurs.
   - The default is 1 hour. 
   - This time does not determine the user experience, but only the security of the overall session system.

- Navigate to your SuperTokens managed service dashboard, and click on the Edit Configuration button.
- In there, change the values of the following fields, and click on save.

```yaml
refresh_token_validity: # Default 144000

access_token_validity: # Default 3600
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip security
We recommend keeping the `access_token_validity` as small as possible because:
- If they are stolen, then token theft detection can only occur after the access token expires.
- If the session is revoked, and the user somehow still has their access token, they will be able to query the APIs until it expires (unless you switch on [access token blacklisting](./revoke-session#access-token-blacklisting)).
