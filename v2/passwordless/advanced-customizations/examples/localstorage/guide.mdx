# Step-by-step guide

In this guide, we'll modify an [example application](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/tree/master/examples/with-emailpassword) to use localstorage instead of cookies.
You can find the modified application [here](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/blob/master/examples/with-localstorage/)

## Backend

On the backend, we need to modify the `api-server.js` to allow and use our custom cookie.
You can find the result [here](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/blob/master/examples/with-localstorage/api-server.js).

### 1. Allow the custom header on requests
First, we need to allow the frontend to send the `st-cookie` header we chose to transfer the tokens.
We can do this by adding it to `allowedHeaders` in the cors config, as seen in [line 125](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/blob/master/examples/with-localstorage/api-server.js#L125).

### 2. Adding a helper
Then, we need to add a helper function that will handle copying the `Set-Cookie` header into our custom header and also add that header
to the `access-control-expose-headers` list so that the frontend can access it on CORS requests.
You can find the implementation in the [updateHeaders function](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/blob/master/examples/with-localstorage/api-server.js#L14-L30).

### 3. Send the tokens using a custom header

Finally, we need to override most of the functions and APIs of the `Session` recipe to have them use the header enabled in the first step and to 
use the helper function defined in the second step to send tokens to the frontend.
You can find the modified session recipe config in [lines 43-116](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/blob/master/examples/with-localstorage/api-server.js#L43-L116)

## Frontend
On the front end, we need to modify our SuperTokens configuration and patch the global fetch function to add our custom header. 
You can find the modified `App.js` [here](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/blob/master/examples/with-localstorage/src/App.js).

### 1. Adding a helper to store cookies
First, we need to add a helper function to process the custom header and store the cookies in the proper format.
You can find a simple implementation in [lines 126-155](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/blob/master/examples/with-localstorage/src/App.js#L126-L155).
Please keep in mind that this isn't an equivalent replacement for cookies; there are many features we didn't implement in the example. Our recommendation is to use cookies if at all possible.

### 2. Replace global fetch

:::important
- This has to be done before calling `SuperTokens.init`.
:::

Then, we need to replace the global fetch to make use of the custom header.
We need to do this because fetch is used internally by the SuperTokens SDK, and we have no other way of getting access to response headers.
You can see how we did it in [lines 73-101](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/blob/master/examples/with-localstorage/src/App.js#L73-L101)

### 3. Clearing cookies on logout

Finally, we need to add an event handler that will clear the cookies on logout. This is done in an event handler in the configuration of the session recipe, as seen in
[lines 116-121](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/blob/master/examples/with-localstorage/src/App.js#L116-L121).

### 4. An optional step is to add an `axios` interceptor

:::important
- This step is only applicable if you are using `axios`
:::

If you are using `axios`, you need to add an interceptor to add the custom header to requests and handle it in responses. 
You can see a basic implementation in [lines 33-71](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/blob/master/examples/with-localstorage/src/App.js#L33-L71).
