# Localstorage instead of cookies

Using the features in Advanced customization, we can customize the SDK to use localstorage instead of cookies set on the server. 

You can find the complete example on [GitHub](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/tree/master/examples/with-localstorage).

## How the modification works

The basic idea behind it is that we can use a custom header to transfer tokens. This way, the frontend can access and 
store them in localstorage or wherever desired and use them to authenticate requests.

### Backend

On the backend, we need to do two things:
- Load tokens from a custom header instead of the `Cookie` header
- Use a custom header to communicate changes to the tokens instead of setting them as cookies

### Frontend

On the frontend we need to do two things:

-   When making a request to the API, we need to add a custom header that contains the tokens we would normally send as cookies
-   After getting a response from the API, we need to inspect the headers and store the contents of a custom header

We can achieve these by replacing the global fetch function with a "patched" version. This must be done before initializing SuperTokens (calling `SuperTokens.init`) as the SDK uses the fetch function internally.

If you use `axios` (or a similar library) to make requests, you also need to add an interceptor that will do the same.
