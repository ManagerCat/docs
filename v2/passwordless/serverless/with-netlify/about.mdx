## [An example GitHub repo](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-auth-react/tree/master/examples/with-netlify) 

:::important
- This example follows the "emailpassword" recipe.
- This guide assumes that you are using Netlify for hosting your serverless API functions. If this is not the case, and you are only hosting your frontend using Netlify, please follow the [Quick setup guide](../../quick-setup/frontend) instead.
