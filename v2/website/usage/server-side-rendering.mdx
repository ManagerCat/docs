# Server side rendering

## About

For server side rendered apps, there will be instances when the access token has expired. In these cases, you need to use the refresh token to get a new access and a new refresh token.

However, the refresh token is only sent to one API endpoint - the refresh API. This means that for all other APIs, you will not have the refresh token as an input. 

Therefore, for refreshing a session during SSR, we must first send a response that manually refreshes the session and then reloads the page. 

## The ```attemptRefreshingSession``` function

<NpmOrScriptTabs>
<TabItem value="npm">

```tsx
import SuperTokens from 'supertokens-website';

await SuperTokens.attemptRefreshingSession();
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="script">


```tsx
await supertokens.attemptRefreshingSession();
```

</TabItem>
</NpmOrScriptTabs>

- Calling the above function will result in a call to your refresh API. If refreshing succeeds, this function will return a `Promise` that will resolve to `true`, else `false`.
- If successful, you can automatically reload the page and the new access token will be sent to your API.
- If unsuccessful, then you should redirect the user to the login page.
