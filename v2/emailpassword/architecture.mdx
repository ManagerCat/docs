## SDKs & Core
There are three components to SuperTokens:
- **Frontend SDK**: Responsible for rendering the login UI widgets and managing session tokens automatically.
- **Backend SDK**: Provides APIs for sign-up, sign-in, signout, session refreshing etc. Your frontend will talk to these APIs.
- **SuperTokens Core**: This is a HTTP service that contains the core logic for auth. It's responsible for interfacing with the database and is used by our backend SDK for operations that require the db.

<Tabs
defaultValue="ms"
values={[
{label: 'Managed service', value: 'ms'},
{label: 'Self hosted', value: 'ss'},
]}>
<TabItem value="ms">
<img src="/img/architecture/managed_service_generic.png" />
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ss">
<img src="/img/architecture/self_hosted_generic.png" />
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Sign in / Sign out flow example

Below is an example of how the three components interact for sign in and sign out flow (with email and password):

The diagram here may not be specific to this recipe. The purpose of this is only to illustrate the general flow of an API from frontend to backend.
