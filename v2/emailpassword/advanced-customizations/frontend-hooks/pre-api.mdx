# Pre API Hook

This function is called before any API call is being made to your backend from our frontend SDK. You can use this to change the request body / url / header or any other request property.

<FrontendSDKTabs>
<TabItem value="reactjs">

```tsx
import EmailPassword from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/emailpassword";

EmailPassword.init({
    preAPIHook: async (context) => {
        let url = context.url;
        
        // is the fetch config object that contains the header, body etc..
        let requestInit = context.requestInit;

        let action = context.action;
        if (action === "EMAIL_EXISTS") {

        } else if (action === "IS_EMAIL_VERIFIED") {

        } else if (action === "SEND_RESET_PASSWORD_EMAIL") {

        } else if (action === "SEND_VERIFY_EMAIL") {

        } else if (action === "EMAIL_PASSWORD_SIGN_IN") {

        } else if (action === "EMAIL_PASSWORD_SIGN_UP") {

        } else if (action === "SUBMIT_NEW_PASSWORD") {

        } else if (action === "VERIFY_EMAIL") {

        }

        // events such as sign out are in the 
        // session recipe pre API hook (See the info box below)
        return {
            requestInit, url
        };
    }
})
```
</TabItem>
</FrontendSDKTabs>

Also checkout the [session recipe pre API hook](/docs/session/advanced-customizations/frontend-hooks/pre-api) for events such as sign out. These will need to go in the `Session.init` config object.
