# React

## General advice 

- Remember to add the JSX pragma and import
- Prefer adding components as `const X: React.FC<PropType> = (props) => {...}` instead of a function returning `JSX.Element`
- When using `useEffect`:
    - If it depends on certain variables inside an object, do not make that object a dependency in the array. Instead, extract the variable from the object before the use effect, and put that variable in the dependency array.
    - If you want it to run it just once (similar to `componentDidMount`), provide it an empty dependency array.
    - If applicable, make sure to return a function that runs in case the dependency array has changed (or the component is unmounting). In this function, you can tell the `useEffect` logic to not change state for example (in case there is an `async / await` operation happening in it.)

- Refrain from returning a component from a function. Instead, make that function itself a functional component. This will prevent that component from unmounting and mounting during rerenders. If you must return a component from a function, then the consumer of that function should use `useRef` or `useMemo`.
