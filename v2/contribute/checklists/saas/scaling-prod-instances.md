## To make sure you cover
- [ ] Should span across multiple ec2 instances
- [ ] Should use multiple cores (two per ec2 instance or one?)
- [ ] Optimise thread pool size and db connection pool size
- [ ] Should be able to handle 1k requests per second
- [ ] We should be able to add more cores / ec2 instances without them having to change their connectionURI
- [ ] Even if one core is alive, their app should work (OK if performance issue).
- [ ] Should be able to hold 1 million sessions / users in the db
- [ ] Health check should happen for each core that is being used + the db + load balancer
- [ ] Add load balancer error monitoring and send notif to slack
